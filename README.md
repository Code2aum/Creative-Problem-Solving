# CREATIVE PROBLEM SOLVING

When it comes to problem solving, even kids who are quick with arithmetic knowledge sometimes get stuck.

They become stumped as soon as an idea is turned into a word problem or a simple mathematical sentence contains an unknown.

That's because problem resolution necessitates our deliberate selection of the best suited strategies for the challenge at hand. This metacognitive capacity is not shared by all students. 

These problem-solving skills, on the other hand, can be taught. All you have to do now is figure out what they are.

Let's start to solve some problems. 1st let's have a look of how to find square of a number ending with 5. To start with let's find 5 squared, 15 squared, 25 squared ...so on as shown below.
>The maximum value of ∫(𝑓(𝑥))3𝑑𝑥 is 𝑝𝑞 if |𝑓(𝑥)|≤1 and ∫10𝑓(𝑥)𝑑𝑥=0. Find 𝑝+𝑞, given that 𝑝,𝑞 are relatively prime.
